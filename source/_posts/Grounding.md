## Grounding with Nature 
Grounding with nature energy can be a simple and effective way to connect with the natural world (Samsara) and replenish your body's energy. 

#### Walking with Nature
1. Find a natural setting to walk in, such as a park, beach, or forest. Choose a place that feels calming and positive to you.

2. As you begin your walk, take a few deep breaths and focus on your breath as you exhale. This can help you to calm your mind and tune in to your surroundings.

3. Pay attention to your senses as you walk. Notice the sights, sounds, and smells around you. Take in the beauty of the natural world and allow yourself to be fully present in the moment.

4. As you walk, focus on the feeling of your feet connecting with the ground. Pay attention to the sensation of each step, and try to feel a sense of connection to the earth.

5. As you walk, let go of any stress or tension you may be carrying. Imagine any negative energy flowing out of your body and into the earth, and visualize positive energy flowing into you from the earth.

6. When you feel grounded and connected to the earth, take a moment to sit or stand in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and focus on your breath, allowing yourself to sink deeper into a state of relaxation and connection to the natural world.

Here's how to ground yourself using active imagination:
#### Active Imagination
Connecting with nature energy through energy work can be a powerful way to tap into the natural world and cultivate a sense of inner balance and harmony. Here are some steps you can follow to connect with nature energy through energy work:

1. Find a comfortable and quiet place where you can sit or stand comfortably. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of your breath as you exhale.

2. Visualize a bright, white light surrounding your entire body. This light represents your own personal energy, and it can help to protect and shield you as you connect with nature energy.

3. Imagine a cord or channel extending from the base of your spine and down into the earth. This cord represents your connection to the earth and the natural world.

4. Visualize a flow of energy moving up through this cord and into your body. This energy represents the positive and nourishing energy of nature.

5. As you visualize this flow of energy, allow yourself to feel it filling your body and filling you with a sense of peace and balance.

6. When you feel connected to the energy of nature, take a few moments to focus on any specific areas of your body or mind that may be in need of healing or balance. Visualize the nature energy flowing into these areas and bringing healing and balance.

7. When you are finished, thank the natural world for its energy and disconnect the cord from your body. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes, feeling grounded and connected to the earth.
