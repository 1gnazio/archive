Everything is energy. Nature, Earth, us; we're all an interconnected system of energy. 

We can never escape the Rhythm of energy in this Universe. This is why we learned Flow. This is also what the Kabbalah/Tree of Life in Hermeticism teaches, Vibration & Rhythm. 

Vibration is the transfer of energy. Energy is always moving; there is no stillness in the flow of energy. 

Let's use Emotions as an example. During states of bliss, the rhythm of the energy is natural. However, during states of anger, your energy becomes unbalanced thus causing the flow of energy to be disrupted. 

Flow is important because it potentiates yourself with your conscious energy, rather than being in a hypnotic unconscious state. 

#### Plants 

Plants are conscious beings, just like every other living cell of Earth. They have their own feelings (Emotions; just like ours) which could imply they have their own personality.
