My notes on the Kundalini.

#### Session 1 - 12/14/2022
I've been theorizing what the Kundalini actually boils down to on a physical level after studying it for a bit. This is what I've come up w/ so far:

The reason people believe the Kundalini to be negative is due to its popularity in lustful Voodoo magic.

Separating the practice from the culture solves this issue so long as your intention is transcendental/divine.

The bliss from Kundalini is the stimulation of the Solar Plexus and the Solar Plexus can be stimulated for sensations of euphoria or bliss without the need to connect with Kundalini energy.

Kundalini is transcendental energy - similarly to your Soul but not as dense. It is metaphysical in nature, this is why past life regression is possible with the energy.

The Kundalini is intelligent energy looking for stimulation. Your intent is what it finds and manifests that to be stimulated so in short, Kundalini is magnetized to your thoughts.

The Golden ray associated with Kundalini is life force energy. You can unlock Chi/life force energy with Kundalini.

You need to push your sexual energy throughout your body by controlling your vagus nerve. The energy goes up this nerve. The Vagus Nerve is the Solar Plexus chakra.

- Visualize Golden energy flowing throughout your body. Stimulate the Kundalini with exercise, crystals, Binaurals, or whatever you choose.

Stimulating the Kundalini to align with your Soul's nature is the synthesis of the great work in Kundalini tantrism. Meditation is very important to exploring the nature of your Soul.
