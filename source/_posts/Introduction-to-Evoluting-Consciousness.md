Evoluting Consciousness is providing clarity on ancient traditons to produce something that can be used to improve yourself and your potential. How? Well, let's just be up front about the core philosophies of this ebook:
* Culture is Dogma: It is illusory and material
* There are natural ways to heal yourself:
    * Nature therapy. Seratonin increases when spending time with nature.
    * Zen Meditation. Training your brain to be mindful of your thoughts and thought-patterns.
    * Sacred Geometry: Potentiating your own DNA just through observation. (EPIGENETICS)
    - Each of these also improve cognition and can fix emotional imbalances.

* There are also tools that can be used to speed up healing:
    * Binaural beats. Training your brain to respond to brainwave entrainment to enter different brain states. Solfeggio tones work through this scientific phenomena.
