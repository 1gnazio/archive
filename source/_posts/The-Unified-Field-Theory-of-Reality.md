According to Nassim Haramein, the Unified Field Theory is based on the idea that the fundamental structure of the universe is a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) field of energy that underlies all matter and energy  including gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.

#### Keypoints:
* Reality is made up of dots with infinite division
* Quantum fields produce particles when charged with the right amount of energy
    + For example, a Proton field would produce a Proton particle and an Electron field would produce an electron particle. 
    + A Higgs Boson field would produce a Higgs Boson particle, but this is a different class of particle all-together. 
        + Scientists built special machinery just to recently discover it and dub it the "God-Particle". 
* The Universe is self-organizing and that everything is connected through this unified field.
* Black holes are the source of the universe, and that they may contain information about the fundamental structure of the universe.
