Culture is antithetical to evolution because culture in itself is hypnotic. Culture is energy and that energy can sometimes be negative in tempting situations.

#### Examples of Exempt Positive Cultures
1. Buddhism
    On the other hand, positive cultures DO exist such as Buddhism which teach virtues like kindness and mindfulness. 

    Meditation, in essence, is spiritual evolution so this culture doesn't apply to other categories of culture like social and busisness.
