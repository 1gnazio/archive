These patterns and symbols are often found in ancient art and architecture, and are believed to have been used as a means of expressing spiritual truths or connecting with the divine.\nOne of the key ideas behind sacred geometry is that certain geometric shapes and patterns have a special resonance or vibration that can affect the human mind and body in positive ways. For example, some people believe that certain geometric shapes or patterns can help to align and balance the energies of the body, or that they can be used as a form of meditation or contemplation to help connect with the divine.\nThere is also a belief that sacred geometry can impact human DNA in a positive way. Some people believe that the geometric patterns and symbols found in sacred geometry can help to activate or awaken dormant strands of DNA, or that they can help to realign and balance the energy of the DNA. This, in turn, is believed to have a positive effect on the physical and spiritual well-being of the individual. It is apart of the epigenetic field in science - so this phenomena has a different foundation that\u0026rsquo;s based on science rather than differing philosophies.\nMany people have found that engaging with sacred geometry through practices such as meditation or contemplation can be a powerful and meaningful experience. Sacred geometry can be a helpful tool for those seeking to connect with their own inner wisdom and to explore the deeper mysteries of the universe.\n","date":"20 December 2022","permalink":"/posts/sacredgeometry/","section":"Posts","summary":"Sacred geometry is a term used to describe the geometric patterns and symbols that are believed to have spiritual and metaphysical significance.

The Law of One suggests that all living beings have the potential to awaken to their true nature as part of this unified consciousness, and that this awakening can lead to a sense of unity and oneness with all things.\nThe Law of One is often associated with the belief in a higher power or a divine force that is the source of all creation, and that is responsible for the ongoing evolution and growth of the universe.

The concept of Kundalini has been embraced by many people as a means of achieving spiritual enlightenment and self-realization. However, some people believe that the awakening of Kundalini can be dangerous or even evil.\nThere are several reasons why some people might view the awakening of Kundalini as an evil process. One reason is that the awakening of Kundalini is often associated with intense physical and emotional experiences, which can be unsettling or even traumatic for some people. Some people might also view the awakening of Kundalini as a form of possession or as a negative influence on their behavior or personality.\nAdditionally, there is a long tradition in some spiritual and religious contexts of viewing certain types of spiritual experiences as dangerous or even demonic. This can lead some people to view the awakening of Kundalini with suspicion or fear.\nIt is important to note that these beliefs about the dangers or evils of Kundalini are not universally held, and many people have had positive experiences with the awakening of Kundalini. It is also worth mentioning that it is not uncommon for people to have intense physical or emotional experiences when engaging in spiritual practices, and these experiences do not necessarily mean that something is wrong or that the practice is evil. It is always a good idea to approach any spiritual practice with caution and to seek the guidance of a trusted spiritual teacher or mentor.\n","date":"20 December 2022","permalink":"/posts/kundalini2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Kundalini is a spiritual and energetic concept in Hinduism and yoga that refers to the awakening of a dormant energy located at the base of the spine.

Some people who have undergone Kundalini awakening have also reported experiencing physical symptoms such as changes in appetite or sleep patterns, or changes in sexual desire.\nThe ultimate goal of Kundalini awakening is said to be the attainment of a state of enlightenment or spiritual realization. It is believed that when Kundalini energy reaches the crown of the head and merges with the highest chakra, it can bring about a state of unity with the divine or universal consciousness.

It is a powerful tool that can help us connect with others on a deeper level and build stronger relationships. But empathy is not just a social skill; it can also have therapeutic benefits, especially for those who have experienced trauma.\nTrauma is any event that causes significant emotional, physical, or psychological harm. It can be a one-time event, such as a car accident or natural disaster, or it can be the result of ongoing abuse or neglect. Trauma can leave deep wounds that can affect a person\u0026rsquo;s mental and emotional health for years, if not a lifetime.\nOne way that empathy can help heal trauma is by providing a sense of validation and understanding. When someone is able to empathize with our experiences, it can help us feel seen and heard, and can also provide a sense of relief. By understanding that our feelings and experiences are normal and valid, we can start to process and heal from our trauma.\nEmpathy can also help break the cycle of isolation that can often come with trauma. When we feel isolated, we may feel like no one understands or cares about what we are going through. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and hopelessness. But when someone demonstrates empathy towards us, it can help us feel connected and supported, which can be incredibly powerful in the healing process.\nIn addition to helping heal trauma, empathy can also help break the illusion of separation that can often be created by trauma. When we are traumatized, we may feel disconnected from ourselves and others, and may view the world as a dangerous and hostile place. Empathy can help us see that we are not alone in our experiences and can help us realize that we are all connected and interdependent. This can be a transformative realization that can help us heal and find meaning in our experiences.\nEmpathy is not always easy, especially when we are dealing with our own pain and suffering. But it is an essential part of the healing process, both for ourselves and for others. By practicing empathy, we can not only help ourselves heal from trauma, but we can also create a more compassionate and connected world.\n","date":"20 December 2022","permalink":"/posts/energywork/","section":"Posts","summary":"Empathy\u003e\rEmpathy # Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others.

Gnostics believed that they possessed a special knowledge or insight (gnosis) that gave them a direct connection to the divine and enabled them to achieve salvation.\nGnostics believed that the material world is fundamentally flawed and that the only way to escape it is through knowledge. They also believed that the gods or deities of traditional religions were actually inferior, demiurgic beings who had created the material world and trapped the divine spark within humans. According to Gnostic teachings, it is only through the acquisition of this special knowledge that one can escape the material world and return to the divine realm.\nGnosticism has had a significant influence on various religious and philosophical movements throughout history, and it continues to be a topic of interest in modern times. Some people have even claimed to have experienced Gnostic-like insights or knowledge through near-death experiences (NDEs).\nNDEs are intense and transformative experiences that some people have reported after coming close to death or suffering a life-threatening injury. These experiences often involve a sense of leaving the body and entering into a realm of light and consciousness beyond the physical world.

Real world examples have been included in each description to demonstrate an example of an occurance operations of the Law.\nThe Law of Mentalism\u003e\rThe Law of Mentalism # This law states that the universe is mental in nature, and that our thoughts and beliefs create our reality. An analogy for this law might be the concept of the ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecy,‚Äù where our expectations and beliefs about a situation can shape the outcome.\nThe Law of Correspondence\u003e\rThe Law of Correspondence # This law states that there is a correspondence between the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the universe), and that what occurs on one level also occurs on the other. An analogy for this law might be the concept of a ‚Äúbutterfly effect,‚Äù where a small change in one part of a system can have significant consequences in other parts of the system.\nThe Law of Vibration\u003e\rThe Law of Vibration # This law states that everything in the universe is in constant motion and vibration, and that the differences between different forms of matter and energy are due to their different rates of vibration. An analogy for this law might be the concept of ‚Äúresonance,‚Äù where two objects vibrating at the same frequency can affect each other‚Äôs vibration.\nThe Law of Polarity\u003e\rThe Law of Polarity # This law states that everything in the universe has an opposite and that these opposites are actually two extremes of the same thing. An analogy for this law might be the concept of ‚Äúhot and cold,‚Äù where hot and cold are opposite ends of the same temperature spectrum.\nThe Law of Rhythm\u003e\rThe Law of Rhythm # This law states that everything in the universe moves in cycles and patterns, and that these rhythms influence each other. An analogy for this law might be the concept of ‚Äútides,‚Äù where the movement of the Earth and the Moon create regular patterns of high and low tide.\nThe Law of Cause and Effect\u003e\rThe Law of Cause and Effect # This law states that every action or event has a cause and an effect, and that these causes and effects are interconnected and form a chain of events.

It teaches that individuals have the power to shape their own reality and that they can achieve a state of spiritual enlightenment through knowledge and understanding of the natural world.\nOne of the key principles of Hermeticism is the concept of the \u0026ldquo;Hermetic Principle\u0026rdquo;, which states that everything is connected and that the microcosm (the individual) reflects the macrocosm (the universe). This principle is often symbolized by the ouroboros, a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, representing the cyclical nature of existence. Hermeticism also emphasizes the importance of balance and harmony in one\u0026rsquo;s life. It teaches that the universe is made up of opposing forces, such as light and darkness, and that individuals must strive to find balance between these forces in order to achieve spiritual growth.\nAnother key aspect of Hermeticism is the belief in the power of the mind and the idea that thoughts have the ability to shape reality. This is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;law of attraction,\u0026rdquo; and involves the idea that positive thoughts can attract positive outcomes, while negative thoughts can attract negative outcomes.\nHermeticism has had a significant influence on Western philosophy and spirituality, and its ideas can be found in a variety of spiritual traditions, including alchemy, astrology, and the occult.\n","date":"19 December 2022","permalink":"/posts/hermetics1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hermeticism is a philosophical and spiritual movement that emerged in ancient Greece and Egypt, and is named after the mythical figure Hermes Trismegistus.
