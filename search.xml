        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Hero’s journey is a concept developed by mythologist Joseph Campbell that describes a common pattern found in many myths, stories, and spiritual traditions around the world. It refers to the journey that a hero or protagonist takes as they leave the familiar world behind and venture into the unknown, facing challenges and overcoming obstacles along the way.</p><p>The Hero’s journey typically follows a specific pattern, which includes the following stages:</p><p>The Call to Adventure: The hero receives a call to leave their familiar world and embark on a journey.</p><p>The Refusal of the Call: The hero initially resists the call, often out of fear or a sense of inadequacy.</p><p>The Meeting with the Mentor: The hero meets a wise and experienced guide who helps them prepare for their journey.</p><p>Crossing the Threshold: The hero decides to embrace the call and leave their familiar world behind.</p><p>Tests, Allies, and Enemies: The hero faces various challenges and makes allies and enemies along the way.</p><p>The Innermost Cave: The hero reaches a point of great danger or difficulty, often symbolizing a crisis of faith or an inner conflict.</p><p>The Supreme Ordeal: The hero confronts their greatest challenge and emerges victorious.</p><p>The Reward: The hero achieves their goal and receives some kind of reward or recognition.</p><p>The Road Back: The hero returns home, often transformed in some way by their journey.</p><p>The Resurrection: The hero experiences some kind of rebirth or enlightenment as a result of their journey.</p><p>The Return with the Elixer: The hero brings back something valuable or transformative that they gained on their journey, and shares it with their community.</p><p>The Hero’s journey is often seen as a metaphor for the journey of self-discovery and personal growth that all individuals go through at some point in their lives. It can be a helpful framework for understanding and exploring one’s own spiritual journey and the challenges and opportunities that arise along the way.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Archetypes are universal patterns or themes that are present in the collective unconscious of all people.</p><p>These archetypes can manifest themselves in various forms, such as symbols, characters, or themes, and can influence an individual’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.</p><h4 id="The-Law-of-One"><a href="#The-Law-of-One" class="headerlink" title="The Law of One"></a>The Law of One</h4><p>The Law of One is a spiritual philosophy that emphasizes the interconnectedness and unity of all things. It suggests that all beings, both physical and non-physical, are ultimately part of the same divine consciousness or “One Infinite Creator.” The Law of One suggests that each individual has a unique path and purpose, and that the ultimate goal is to achieve a state of higher consciousness or enlightenment.</p><p>The Law of One identifies several archetypes that are believed to be universal patterns or themes present in the collective unconscious of all people. These archetypes are thought to be helpful in understanding and exploring one’s own spiritual journey and the challenges and opportunities that arise along the way.</p><p>We will cover the Law of One more indepth in another post but some of the archetypes identified in the Law of One include:</p><p>The Healer: This archetype represents the desire to heal and help others. It is associated with compassion, empathy, and a desire to make a positive difference in the world.</p><p>The Teacher: This archetype represents the desire to share knowledge and wisdom with others. It is associated with a desire to learn and grow, as well as a desire to help others do the same.</p><p>The Explorer: This archetype represents the desire to discover new things and seek out new experiences. It is associated with a sense of adventure and a desire to push the boundaries of what is known.</p><p>The Creator: This archetype represents the desire to create and bring new things into being. It is associated with imagination, innovation, and a desire to bring one’s ideas and vision to fruition.</p><p>The Warrior: This archetype represents the desire to defend and protect others. It is associated with courage, determination, and a willingness to take action in the face of challenges.</p><p>The Visionary: This archetype represents the ability to see beyond the present and envision a better future. It is associated with a sense of purpose and a desire to make the world a better place.</p><p>It is important to note that these archetypes are not mutually exclusive and that an individual may embody multiple archetypes at the same time. The Law of One suggests that by exploring and understanding these archetypes, an individual may be able to gain a deeper understanding of their own spiritual path and purpose.</p><p>You can read more about this school of thought here: lawofone.info&#x2F;</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Hermetic laws of the universe are a set of principles that describe how the universe functions and how we can align ourselves with these principles in order to manifest our desires and create positive change in our lives. </p><p>These laws are  depicted in the form of the Tree of Life, a diagram used in the mystical teachings of the Kabbalah which represents the interconnectedness of all creation and provides a path to spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>Here are brief explanations of each of the Hermetic laws. Real world examples have been included in each description to demonstrate an example of an occurance operations of the Law. </p><h4 id="The-Law-of-Mentalism"><a href="#The-Law-of-Mentalism" class="headerlink" title="The Law of Mentalism"></a>The Law of Mentalism</h4><p> This law states that the universe is mental in nature, and that our thoughts and beliefs create our reality. An analogy for this law might be the concept of the “self-fulfilling prophecy,” where our expectations and beliefs about a situation can shape the outcome.</p><h4 id="The-Law-of-Correspondence"><a href="#The-Law-of-Correspondence" class="headerlink" title="The Law of Correspondence"></a>The Law of Correspondence</h4><p> This law states that there is a correspondence between the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the universe), and that what occurs on one level also occurs on the other. An analogy for this law might be the concept of a “butterfly effect,” where a small change in one part of a system can have significant consequences in other parts of the system.</p><h4 id="The-Law-of-Vibration"><a href="#The-Law-of-Vibration" class="headerlink" title="The Law of Vibration"></a>The Law of Vibration</h4><p> This law states that everything in the universe is in constant motion and vibration, and that the differences between different forms of matter and energy are due to their different rates of vibration. An analogy for this law might be the concept of “resonance,” where two objects vibrating at the same frequency can affect each other’s vibration.</p><h4 id="The-Law-of-Polarity"><a href="#The-Law-of-Polarity" class="headerlink" title="The Law of Polarity"></a>The Law of Polarity</h4><p> This law states that everything in the universe has an opposite and that these opposites are actually two extremes of the same thing. An analogy for this law might be the concept of “hot and cold,” where hot and cold are opposite ends of the same temperature spectrum.</p><h4 id="The-Law-of-Rhythm"><a href="#The-Law-of-Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="The Law of Rhythm"></a>The Law of Rhythm</h4><p> This law states that everything in the universe moves in cycles and patterns, and that these rhythms influence each other. An analogy for this law might be the concept of “tides,” where the movement of the Earth and the Moon create regular patterns of high and low tide.</p><h4 id="The-Law-of-Cause-and-Effect"><a href="#The-Law-of-Cause-and-Effect" class="headerlink" title="The Law of Cause and Effect"></a>The Law of Cause and Effect</h4><p> This law states that every action or event has a cause and an effect, and that these causes and effects are interconnected and form a chain of events. An analogy for this law might be the concept of “dominoes,” where knocking over one domino can cause a chain reaction of other dominos falling as well.</p><h4 id="The-Law-of-Gender"><a href="#The-Law-of-Gender" class="headerlink" title="The Law of Gender"></a>The Law of Gender</h4><p> This law states that everything in the universe exhibits both masculine and feminine qualities, and that these qualities are necessary for creation and manifestation. An analogy for this law might be the concept of “yin and yang,” where opposite forces are seen as complementary and necessary for balance.</p>]]></content>

      <url>/2022/12/16/What-re-Binaural-Beats/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Binaural beats are a type of auditory illusion that is created when two slightly different sound frequencies are played through headphones or speakers, one in each ear. The brain perceives the difference between the two frequencies as a third, separate frequency, known as the binaural beat.</p><p>Binaural beats are often used in brainwave entrainment, which is a process by which the brain’s electrical activity, or brainwaves, can be influenced by external stimuli, such as sound or light. When a person listens to binaural beats, their brainwaves can start to match the frequency of the binaural beat, a process known as brainwave entrainment or brainwave synchronization.</p><p>The brain produces different types of brainwaves depending on the mental state it is in. For example, beta brainwaves are associated with alertness and concentration, while alpha brainwaves are associated with relaxation and meditation. By listening to binaural beats that correspond to a specific brainwave frequency, it is possible to influence the brain’s activity and mental state. For example, listening to binaural beats in the alpha frequency range may help to induce a state of relaxation, while listening to binaural beats in the beta frequency range may help to improve focus and concentration.</p><ul><li>It is important to note that the effects of brainwave entrainment using binaural beats may vary from person to person, and it is not a replacement for medical treatment or therapy. If you are experiencing mental health concerns or other health issues, it is important to seek the advice of a qualified healthcare professional.</li></ul>]]></content>

This is why we learned Flow. This is also what the Kabbalah&#x2F;Tree of Life in Hermeticism teaches, Vibration &amp; Rhythm. </p><p>Vibration is the transfer of energy. Energy is always moving; there is no stillness in the flow of energy. </p><p>Let’s use Emotions as an example. During states of bliss, the rhythm of the energy is natural. However, during states of anger, your energy becomes unbalanced thus causing the flow of energy to be disrupted. </p><p>Flow is important because it potentiates yourself with your conscious energy, rather than being in a hypnotic unconscious state. </p><h4 id="Plants"><a href="#Plants" class="headerlink" title="Plants"></a>Plants</h4><p>Plants are conscious beings, just like every other living cell of Earth. They have their own feelings (Emotions; just like ours) which could imply they have their own personality.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My notes on the Kundalini.</p><h4 id="Session-1-12-x2F-14-x2F-2022"><a href="#Session-1-12-x2F-14-x2F-2022" class="headerlink" title="Session 1 - 12&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022"></a>Session 1 - 12&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022</h4><p>I’ve been theorizing what the Kundalini actually boils down to on a physical level after studying it for a bit. This is what I’ve come up w&#x2F; so far:</p><p>The reason people believe the Kundalini to be negative is due to its popularity in lustful Voodoo magic.</p><p>Separating the practice from the culture solves this issue so long as your intention is transcendental&#x2F;divine.</p><p>The bliss from Kundalini is the stimulation of the Solar Plexus and the Solar Plexus can be stimulated for sensations of euphoria or bliss without the need to connect with Kundalini energy.</p><p>Kundalini is transcendental energy - similarly to your Soul but not as dense. It is metaphysical in nature, this is why past life regression is possible with the energy.</p><p>The Kundalini is intelligent energy looking for stimulation. Your intent is what it finds and manifests that to be stimulated so in short, Kundalini is magnetized to your thoughts.</p><p>The Golden ray associated with Kundalini is life force energy. You can unlock Chi&#x2F;life force energy with Kundalini.</p><p>You need to push your sexual energy throughout your body by controlling your vagus nerve. The energy goes up this nerve. The Vagus Nerve is the Solar Plexus chakra.</p><ul><li>Visualize Golden energy flowing throughout your body. Stimulate the Kundalini with exercise, crystals, Binaurals, or whatever you choose.</li></ul><p>Stimulating the Kundalini to align with your Soul’s nature is the synthesis of the great work in Kundalini tantrism. Meditation is very important to exploring the nature of your Soul.</p>]]></content>
