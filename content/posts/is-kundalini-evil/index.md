We broke down the processes of Kundalini in the last post, now that we have an idea of what Kundalini is, we can now go ahead and question whether or not Kundalini is a force of positivity or negativity. 

#### Kundalini's Polarity

The textbook definition of Kundalini is "negatively polarized creative energy". Let's go over some ways this could be true:

They do teach us to use our Crown Chakra to make the energy positively polarized, but that requires an opening of the Crown Chakra; and some people don't even have these! 

Therefore, let's assume Kundalini may lack a function of empathy, then we can draw a conclusion to if empathy is not ritualized then Kundalini will be magnetized to your subconscious desires rather than your conscious goals.

I believe if this is true, you have to use the energy positively by being conscious and aware of your crown chakra. The crown chakra is responsible for quantum awareness, like past life regression for example.
