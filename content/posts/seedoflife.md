The Seed of Life is a geometric pattern that consists of seven circles arranged in a specific pattern. The circles are arranged in a way that creates a flower-like pattern, with the circles forming the petals of the flower. The Seed of Life is often depicted as a two-dimensional pattern, but it can also be represented in three-dimensional form.

In sacred geometry, the Seed of Life is considered to be a powerful symbol that represents the creation and manifestation of life. It is believed to contain the fundamental principles of creation, and to be a symbol of the interconnectedness and unity of all things.
