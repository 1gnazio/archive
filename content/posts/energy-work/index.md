#### Prerequisites
Read the [Grounding your energy](/posts/grounding-your-energy) article before starting this course. Thank you! 

## Developing your Toolset
#### 1. Perception
The first thing you should learn is how your mind signatures energy.

* Do you see emotions as colors?
* Do you see entities in a humanoid form? 
* Do you hear voices? 
* Does your nose randomly get irritated by a smell seemingly from nowhere?

Whichever sense has the extra sensory perception ability will tell you which clairvoyant or psychic ability you possess. 

Once you understand this, you should be able to train this ability. 

#### 2. Shielding
Shielding is very important to your energy. If you have no shield, expect subconscious energy to attack you constantly from around the environment. 

Sadly, the Earth is a miasma in terms of our species' subconscious. Hopefully, this will be fixed soon. To combat this, we developed techniques to shield ourselves from alien energies unknown to ourselves. 

Mantras do work! Repeating "I am shielded" is quite literally reprogramming your subconscious mind to KNOW you are shielded; thus letting your semi-awake mind do all the work for you.

Imagining your energy in the form of a Torus eminating from your body and then imagine a bubble around you of a material that protects you.
