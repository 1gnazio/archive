Gnosticism is a term that refers to a diverse set of religious movements that flourished in the early centuries of the Common Era, particularly in the Mediterranean world.

At its core, Gnosticism is characterized by the belief that knowledge (gnosis in Greek) is the key to achieving salvation. Gnostics believed that they possessed a special knowledge or insight (gnosis) that gave them a direct connection to the divine and enabled them to achieve salvation.

Gnostics believed that the material world is fundamentally flawed and that the only way to escape it is through knowledge. They also believed that the gods or deities of traditional religions were actually inferior, demiurgic beings who had created the material world and trapped the divine spark within humans. According to Gnostic teachings, it is only through the acquisition of this special knowledge that one can escape the material world and return to the divine realm.

Gnosticism has had a significant influence on various religious and philosophical movements throughout history, and it continues to be a topic of interest in modern times. Some people have even claimed to have experienced Gnostic-like insights or knowledge through near-death experiences (NDEs).

NDEs are intense and transformative experiences that some people have reported after coming close to death or suffering a life-threatening injury. These experiences often involve a sense of leaving the body and entering into a realm of light and consciousness beyond the physical world. Some people who have had NDEs report having had profound insights and knowledge about the nature of reality, similar to the Gnostic belief in the acquisition of special knowledge as a means of achieving salvation.
