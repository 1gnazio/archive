Sacred geometry is a term used to describe the geometric patterns and symbols that are believed to have spiritual and metaphysical significance. These patterns and symbols are often found in ancient art and architecture, and are believed to have been used as a means of expressing spiritual truths or connecting with the divine.

One of the key ideas behind sacred geometry is that certain geometric shapes and patterns have a special resonance or vibration that can affect the human mind and body in positive ways. For example, some people believe that certain geometric shapes or patterns can help to align and balance the energies of the body, or that they can be used as a form of meditation or contemplation to help connect with the divine.

There is also a belief that sacred geometry can impact human DNA in a positive way. Some people believe that the geometric patterns and symbols found in sacred geometry can help to activate or awaken dormant strands of DNA, or that they can help to realign and balance the energy of the DNA. This, in turn, is believed to have a positive effect on the physical and spiritual well-being of the individual. It is apart of the epigenetic field in science - so this phenomena has a different foundation that's based on science rather than differing philosophies. 

Many people have found that engaging with sacred geometry through practices such as meditation or contemplation can be a powerful and meaningful experience. Sacred geometry can be a helpful tool for those seeking to connect with their own inner wisdom and to explore the deeper mysteries of the universe.
