#### The Mythology

There are many cultures throughout history that have had mythologies, folklore, and religious beliefs that associate the moon with negative or malevolent forces. 

For example, in some Native American cultures, the moon is associated with witchcraft and malevolent spirits. In ancient Egyptian mythology, the moon god Thoth was often depicted as a trickster and was associated with deception. In Hinduism, the demon king Rahu is believed to be the personification of an eclipse and is associated with chaos and destruction.

On the other hand of-course, the moon was considered to be positive by cultures such as ancient Greek mythology, in which the moon was associated with the goddess Artemis, who was revered as a protector of women, children, and animals. In ancient Rome, the moon was associated with the goddess Diana, who was also a protector of women and childbirth. In many other Native American cultures, the moon is seen as a feminine symbol and is associated with the cycle of life and the changing of the seasons.


#### The Science

1. Tidal forces: The moon's gravitational pull causes tides in the Earth's oceans. As the moon orbits the Earth, it pulls on the oceans, causing the water to rise and fall. This leads to the familiar pattern of high and low tides that we see along coastlines.

2. Stabilization of the Earth's axis: The moon helps to stabilize the Earth's axis, which is the imaginary line around which the planet rotates. Without the moon, the Earth's axis would be much more unstable and the planet's climate would be much less predictable.

3. Lunar eclipses: When the moon passes directly between the Earth and the sun, it can cause a lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the moon appears reddish in color, which is why it is sometimes called a "blood moon."

4. Influence on the Earth's rotation: The moon's gravitational pull also affects the Earth's rotation. Because of the moon's gravitational pull, the Earth's day is getting longer by about 1.4 milliseconds per century.

5. Influence on the Earth's orbit: The moon's gravitational pull also affects the Earth's orbit around the sun. The moon's gravitational influence causes the Earth's orbit to be slightly elliptical, rather than perfectly circular. This means that the Earth is sometimes closer to the sun and sometimes farther away, which leads to the change in seasons that we experience on the planet.

6. **Influence on brainwaves**: The Lunarsight brainwave index reports the frequency 420.82 Hz to be associated with the Moon and with the attributes of love, sensitivity, creativity, femininity, and anima.

#### Conclusion
We can extrapolate from the brainwave index that the Moon plays a fundamental role in the collective human consciousness, in particular, the Moon powers the Anima; the right-hand side of the human brain. This is the conclusion we have come to make.

#### Anima Reference
1. The Anima is the unconscious feminine psychological qualities that are present in men. It is one of the two primary archetypes in the psyche of men, the other being the animus, which represents the unconscious masculine psychological qualities in women. The anima is often associated with emotion, intuition, and creativity. It is believed that a man's relationship with his anima can significantly influence his attitudes and behaviors towards women and his own emotional life.

2. Carl Jung, founder of psychoanalysis, believed that the anima is a part of the collective unconscious, which is a part of the psyche that is shared by all humans and is inherited rather than learned. The collective unconscious is thought to contain the archetypes, which are universal symbolic patterns that are present in the mythology, religion, and literature of all cultures.

3. Jung believed that the anima is a vital part of a man's psyche and that it plays a crucial role in his development and individuation, which is the process of becoming a fully-realized, autonomous individual. He believed that men who are able to integrate their anima into their conscious awareness and develop a healthy relationship with it are better able to understand and express their emotions, be more empathetic and compassionate, and have a more balanced and harmonious relationship with the opposite sex.
