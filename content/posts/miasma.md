**TRIGGER WARNING**: This topic goes over every negative aspect of our environment. Do not read this if you are easily triggered.{{< /alert >}}

We are attacked daily by the following methods, with intentions I assume align with increasing our subconscious tendencies while subverting consciousness:
* Physical nanobots 
* Negative thought-forms (Entities)
* Negative electromagnetic radiation (think-5G)
and more. 

View the Table of Contents on the side of the screen to see the full list of topics. 

#### Physical Nanobots
These are aware, mechanical organisms living within our body. 

Their intention is to increase our agitation and decrease our ability to focus and communicate effectively with others. 

They are aware enough to respond to their names being read. We won't disclose that information here. 

#### Negative Thought Forms
There are certain thought-forms or energies that are believed to be powered by negative emotions. These thought-forms or energies can have a negative influence on the individual, causing energy blockages and potentially even causing harm to others.

However, it is important to note that these thought-forms or energies can often have a greater impact on the individual themselves, propagating energy blockages and potentially causing harm to the person's own well-being.

To break free from the influence of these thought-forms or energies, it is recommended to engage in practices such as meditation or contemplation, focusing on memories or feelings of joy, bliss, and euphoria. This can help to break the hold of these negative energies and unblock any energy blockages that may be present.

The "waterfall technique" is another practice that can be helpful in unblocking energy and breaking free from the influence of negative thought-forms or energies. This technique involves visualizing a waterfall of light or energy flowing through the body, cleansing and purifying the energy channels and releasing any blockages or negativity that may be present.

Overall, it is important to be mindful of the energies and thought-forms that we allow into our lives, and to practice techniques that can help us to break free from the influence of negativity and unblock our own energy.
