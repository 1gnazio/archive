#### What's Christ Consciousness? 
Christ Consciousness is a state of consciousness in which you have formed a union with your divine self which is also a part of your creative mind.

Your abilities from this life and maybe some from other lifetimes feel as natural as breathing air during christ consciousness. 

To achieve this state, you must learn how to flow with the divinity within your mind. You must be able to recognize your conscious mind from your subconscious mind. 

#### Merkaba: the Light Body
The light body or Merkaba is an etherical body that connects us to our fifth dimensional selves, in which we can transcend the normal limitations of reality to perform actions as great as the stories of Jesus Christ.
#### The Etymology of Merkaba is as follows:
| Letter | Meaning   |
|----|---------------|
| Me | Light-energy  |
| r  | Anchoring     |
| ka | Spirit-action |
| ba | body-action   |

This can paint a better picture of the concept by understanding what the word means letter-by-letter. It could also be a _sacred word_, like vinegar; a word that's protected in every culture.

#### Light Body Functions
Here are some things I've experienced with my light body. I believe this can be passed onto anyone by potentiating your DNA with sacred geometry; learn more about that under the Sacred Geometry topic. 

* Healing w/ streams of light & vibration
* Mental projection anywhere 

It is important to realize empathy must become a discipline in order to work with this high vibrational practice.
