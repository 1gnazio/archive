#### What's Soul Transmigration? 
The transmigration of the human soul, also known as reincarnation or rebirth, is a concept that has been embraced by spiritual traditions around the world for thousands of years. The origins of this belief can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Hindus, who all believed in the existence of an eternal soul or consciousness that could be reborn into a new body after the physical body died.

In many cultures, the transmigration of the soul is seen as a natural part of the cycle of life and death, and is often depicted as a journey or a process of transformation. This belief has been embraced by various spiritual traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, which all hold that the soul is immortal and can be reborn in a new body after death.

The concept of transmigration has also been influential in shaping the worldviews of other cultures and spiritual traditions around the world. In ancient Greek mythology, for example, the concept of reincarnation was closely tied to the idea of the hero's journey and the idea that the soul could be reborn into a new body after death. In some Native American cultures, the transmigration of the soul is seen as a way of preserving the continuity of the community and the connection to the natural world.

#### Gnosticism and the Soul Transmigration 
Gnosticism is a modern term used to describe a diverse group of ancient religious movements that emerged in the eastern Mediterranean region in the early Christian era. 

These movements were characterized by their emphasis on mystical knowledge (aka _Gnosis_) as a means of achieving salvation and enlightenment.

Gnostic teachings explain the physical world is illusory and that the true nature of reality is spiritual & transcendent.

In recent years, some people have drawn comparisons between Gnosticism and modern near-death experiences (NDEs), in which individuals who have come close to death report having profound spiritual or transcendent experiences. Some people have suggested that NDEs may provide insights into the nature of reality and the human soul that are similar to the teachings of Gnosticism.
