#### What is Kundalini?

Kundalini is an evolutionary force of consciousness that can be awakened to explore more ways to express yourself. Some people believe it's evil while others believe it's divine, which is discussed in the next post of this series.

#### Awakening your Kundalini

Kundalini awakening refers to the activation and ascent of Kundalini energy, a type of spiritual energy believed to reside within the human body. According to some spiritual traditions, Kundalini energy is said to be coiled like a serpent at the base of the spine, and its awakening is thought to be associated with a range of spiritual and physical experiences.

The process of Kundalini awakening is said to involve the activation and movement of this energy from the base of the spine up through the chakras (energy centers located along the spine) and eventually to the crown of the head. This process is often described as a “serpent rising” or “serpent ascending,” as the movement of Kundalini energy is thought to resemble a serpent moving upwards through the body.

As Kundalini energy moves through the chakras, it is said to bring about a range of physical and emotional changes, including feelings of heat, tingling, or vibrations in the body; changes in consciousness; and the experience of visions or insights. Some people who have undergone Kundalini awakening have also reported experiencing physical symptoms such as changes in appetite or sleep patterns, or changes in sexual desire.

The ultimate goal of Kundalini awakening is said to be the attainment of a state of enlightenment or spiritual realization. It is believed that when Kundalini energy reaches the crown of the head and merges with the highest chakra, it can bring about a state of unity with the divine or universal consciousness. Some people describe this as a fluid sensation traveling up the spine and into the cerebrum (the upper part of the brain).
